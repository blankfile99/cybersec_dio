## 🧩 Challenge Description...
Implement, document, and share a practical project using Kali Linux and the Medusa tool, along with vulnerable environments (for example, Metasploitable 2 and DVWA), to simulate brute-force attack scenarios and practice mitigation measures.

---

## 🎯 Objectives...
- [ ] Discover active hosts...  
- [ ] Enumerate ports and services...  
- [ ] Identify and exploit weak authentication via Medusa...  
- [ ] Demonstrate privilege escalation paths...  
- [ ] Document prevention and mitigation measures...

## 🧪 Environment...
We use VirtualBox with two VMs, Kali Linux and Metasploitable2, on a Host-Only network for isolation and repeatability.

**Minimum requirements...**  
- Kali Linux VM
- Metasploitable2 VM
- VirtualBox installed

**Quick setup steps...**  
1. Create two VMs in VirtualBox, one Kali and one Metasploitable2...  
2. In each VM → Settings → Network, set **Adapter 1: Host-Only Adapter**...  
3. Optionally, we can assign static IPs or rely on Host-Only DHCP, e.g., `192.168.56.10` (Kali), `192.168.56.101` (Metasploitable2)...  
4. From Kali, verify connectivity:  
   ```bash
   ping -c 3 192.168.56.101
