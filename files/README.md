## 🧪 Environment...
We're using Visual Code Studio on a windows 10 Machine.

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
Ransomware attack consists in encrypt user files and ask for money to decrypt them back.
The program can Encrypt ALL FILES ON DISK, that's why it's extremely dangerous.

The program follow these steps:
1. Create and Load a Encryption Key.
2. Create a List with all Files.
3. Encrypt it all!!
4. Create a Messege to User.
5. Show the Messege when User try to Access any file.

Keylogger attack use to monitoring a target computer to get key and screen captures to steal data from a target user.
You can filter what to listen or not, keys as SHIFT, TAB, CTRL, ARROWS are not interesting to listen to not polute the output.

## ⚙️ How to turn this programs invisible
Just change the extension to .pyw

## ⚙️ How to Send the log by e-mail
In this learning process, an google email can be created exclusively to this purpose.
Activate Two-Factor Security and go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
This way, this email will be able to receive emails directly from your app.
